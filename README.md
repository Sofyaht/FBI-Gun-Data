## Datasets - FBI Gun Data and US Census Data

- The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase.

## Questions For Analysis

- What Census Data is most associated with high gun per capita?
- Which states have had the highest growth in gun registrations?
- What is the overall trend of gun purchases?

## Key Insights

- Question 1: The gun per capita was calculated by dividing the total guns per state for that year and the population census. The census data with the highest gun per capita is 2016 population census. The states of District Of Columbia, Guam, Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and Virgin Island were exempted from this analysis due to incomplete data. The states with the highest gun per capita for 2010 and 2016 was Kentucky.
- Question 2: Califonia followed by Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Florida has the highest growth in gun registrations
- Question 3: Gun purchases has increased exponentially since 1997 up until 2016 and then decreased in 2017 but this can be partially due to the 2017 data having only gun registrations for 9 months
